## ELMo embeddings generated during execution of `lstm_elmo.py` script.

During training, if not disabled, the script will generate contextual ELMo embeddings for each token in the data set. The result will be stored in this folder.
This needs to be done just once per data set, if you want to disable the generation, you can comment the lines in the script.
